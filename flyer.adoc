:image:img/logo_new.png

The People's Liberation and Training Committee is a Marxist-Leninist organization aimed at educating party members in wilderness and urban survival, first aid, communications and firearms. 

We are not a party, and never aim to be one. However, all members are required to join a party or provide docimentation as to why they cannot. 

We are not a militia. We will never be a militia. All members are required to follow applicable federal and state laws around firearms, and are prohibited from participating in any demonstration open carrying or illegally concealed carrying a firearm, as PLTCOM members.
