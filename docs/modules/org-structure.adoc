= Organizational Structure

PLT-COM is organized via Democratic Centralism. This method fuses the traditional debate and discussion of democracy, with the discipline of centralism. In other words, democratic centralism is "Freedom in discussion and unity in action".

For example, Local PLT-COM chapters see the need for a food distribution network at the ground level. Chapters submit Ground Report Forms (GRFs) detailing their observations and needs.The central committee starts an information gathering period. Chapters pass information and ideas up the chain to the central committee. The central committee gathers all available data, formulates a plan, then enters a debate period. During the debate period, chapters will deliberate the contents of the plan and return either a decision or changes to the plan. Once the debate period has closed, the central committee then implements the plan for a food distribution network. Changes to the food distribution network are not made once a decision has been reached, unless there is something that is obviously not functioning properly, which can be brought to the attention of the central committee in the same fashion the problem of food distribution was originally brought up.
