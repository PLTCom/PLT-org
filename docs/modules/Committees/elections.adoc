= Elections
It is extremely important that PLTCOM members participate in the selection of their leadership. However, direct election of leadership can quickly turn into a popularity contest, which should be avoided. To balance these two requirements, the election procedure below has been implemented.


== Committee Directors

Any person pursuing nomination for committee directorship must submit an application.

The committee members will nominate 1-3 other members to lead the committee after reviewing the submitted directorship application.

The Central Committee will review the nominations, conduct interviews and vote on the most qualified candidate. The candidate winning a majority of votes from the nominating committee will be chosen as the winner.
